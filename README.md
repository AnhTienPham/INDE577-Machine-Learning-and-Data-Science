## Overview of Machine learning
Machine learning is a field of study that aims to develop algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is based on the idea that machines can learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions based on those patterns. 

## Supervised learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns to map input data to output labels based on a set of examples. The goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, which can then be used to make predictions on new data. 

### [Perceptron](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/Perceptron/Perceptron.ipynb)
A linear classifier used for binary classification problems, which can be trained using a simple algorithm to adjust weights and bias.

### [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/GradientDescent/GradientDescent.ipynb)
An optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the gradient.

### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/RegressionNeuron/RegressionNeuron.ipynb)
A linear model used for predicting a continuous numerical output variable, where the relationship between input and output is assumed to be linear.

### [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/LogisticNeuron/LogisticNeuron.ipynb)
A statistical model used for predicting a binary output variable, where the relationship between input and output is modeled using a logistic function.

### [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/DeepNeuralNetwork/DeepNeuralNetwork.ipynb)
A multi-layer neural network consisting of several layers of interconnected nodes, which is trained using backpropagation to learn complex patterns in data.

### [Decision Tree](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/DecisionTree/DecisionTree.ipynb)
A tree-like model that uses a sequence of binary decisions based on input features to make predictions or classify data.

### [Ensemble Method](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/EnsembleMethod%26RandomForest/EnsembleMethod%26RandomForest.ipynb) 
A technique that combines multiple models to improve the overall performance of a prediction or classification task.

### [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/Knearestneighbors/Knearestneighbor.ipynb)
A non-parametric model that classifies data based on the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors in a feature space.

## Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any specific guidance. The goal is to learn the underlying structure of the data, such as clustering, density estimation or dimensionality reduction. Unsupervised learning is used in applications such as anomaly detection, data compression and recommendation systems.

### [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/KmeansClustering/KmeansClustering.ipynb)
An unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on the similarity of features.

### [PCA](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/PCA/PCA.ipynb)
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of the information.

### [DBSCAN](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/DBSCAN/DBSCAN.ipynb)
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together while separating points that are far apart or outliers.

## Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns to make decisions based on feedback from the environment. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns to take actions that maximize a cumulative reward signal. The goal is to find an optimal policy that maps states to actions, which can be used to solve complex decision-making problems.

### [K Arm Bandit](https://github.com/AnhTienPham/INDE577-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/main/Reinforement%20Learning/K_arms_bandits.ipynb)
A reinforcement learning algorithm that attempts to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off when making decisions, typically used in contexts where there are multiple choices, and the reward for each choice is uncertain.
